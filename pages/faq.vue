      <!-- Data Source -->
      <div class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6">
        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Where does the data come from?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          All data is sourced directly from the official UK Police Data API (data.police.uk). This ensures that our information is accurate, up-to-date, and matches official records. We do not modify or alter the data in any way, only presenting it in an accessible format.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Data Updates -->
      <div class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6">
        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">How often is the data updated?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          The UK Police Data API updates its data monthly, typically with a two-month delay. For example, January's data becomes available in March. This delay allows for proper data validation and processing by police forces. Our platform automatically fetches the latest available data as soon as it's published.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Data Coverage -->
      <div class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6">
        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">What time period does the data cover?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          Our platform provides access to the last 24 months of stop and search data. The current month and previous month are typically not available due to the processing delay in the official police data system. This ensures we only display validated and complete data sets.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Data Accuracy -->
      <div class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6">
        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">How accurate is the data?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          The data comes directly from police records and undergoes validation before being published. However, some incidents might have incomplete information or approximate locations for privacy and operational reasons. We clearly indicate when data is estimated or incomplete.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Platform Usage -->
      <div class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6">
        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">How do I use the interactive map?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          The interactive map allows you to explore stop and search incidents geographically. You can:

      <!-- Data Download -->
      <div class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6">
        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Can I download the data?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          Yes, you can access the raw data directly from the <a href="https://data.police.uk" class="text-primary hover:text-primary-dark">data.police.uk</a> website.

      <div class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm p-6">
        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Is this an official police website?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          No, this is an independent open-source platform. We are not affiliated with, endorsed by, or operated by any UK police force or government agency. Our mission is to make public police data more accessible and transparent through better visualization and analysis tools.
